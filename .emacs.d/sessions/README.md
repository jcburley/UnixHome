# ~/unixhome/.emacs.d/sessions/

This directory has subdirectories with usernames, followed by '@',
followed by names of ("pet", not "cattle") systems, in which things
like customizations files are kept.

That way, the customizations remain per-machine (helpful across multiple OSes),
but are tracked via git.
